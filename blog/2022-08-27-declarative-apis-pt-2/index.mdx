[Last time](./declarative-apis-pt1) we took a look at SQL,
one of the most popular declarative APIs, and imagined what it would look like if identifiers
were controlled by the system instead of the user,
e.g. you must look up the identifier for a table in order to add records to it.

This was inconvenient, but workable within the sequential context of SQL execution.
Now, let's use a less contrived example to see how it extends
to control plane APIs, where forcing sequential execution makes modeling workflows complex and frankly
just not fun.

In Kubernetes, configuration is often created separately from application deployments and
loaded by referencing the configuration's name.

```yaml
# app.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: webserver
spec:
  # ...
  template:
    # ...
    spec:
      volumes:
        - name: config-volume
          configMap:
            name: webserver-config
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: webserver-config
data:
  config.yaml: "..."
```

The ability to just say "pull in the config named 'webserver-config'" gets us a couple great things:
* Can recreate the entire setup without changing the configuration, just by moving namespaces or deleting the old ones.
* Can create or update both resources with just `kubectl apply --file app.yaml`, without having to specify any order

The Kubernetes control plane takes care of resolving these references in the
background and allows us to create all the resources for our application _asynchronously_.



But let's back up and assume we aren't able to name
the resources ourselves â€” how would this workflow change?

First, we'd have to create our configuration and parse the name from the response.

```shell
CONFIGMAP_NAME=$(\
  kubectl create configmap \
    --file ./config.yaml \
    -o json | jq -r '.metadata.name'\
)
```

Then, we'd need to use the name of the created `ConfigMap` to reference it in our `Deployment`.

```shell
cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: webserver
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    spec:
      volumes:
	  - name: config-volume
	    configMap:
	      name: $CONFIGMAP_NAME
EOF
```

This adds a lot of manual steps, and we haven't even talked about things like updates and deletions!

Without the ability to set the identifiers when creating resources, users are forced to build these
manual workflows themselves, in each language/tool they need them.

Pretty soon, you've grown from a handful of shell scripts to libraries in four different languages,
custom GitHub Actions, an in-house Terraform provider...
all with their own orchestration and heavy maintenance burden.

Putting as much of this orchestration into the system as
possible helps people build less of it themselves, increasing ease of adoption.
**Just like SQL, we want our API users to be able to think only
about what they want the final outcome to look like, not how to get there.**

Allowing users to provide identifiers for your APIs is critical for **easy,
powerful workflows that get shit done and focus on what matters.**
