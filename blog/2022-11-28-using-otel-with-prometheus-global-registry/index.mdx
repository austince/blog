# Using OpenTelemetry with a Prometheus Global Registry

OpenTelemetry (OTel) has been on my radar for a while, but learning it has been too daunting a task to start.
I recently had the opportunity (read: no escape) when it came time to instrument our applications at
[Immerok](https://immerok.io).

<!--truncate-->

## Context

We use Golang for most of the stack for many reasons (holding back from a full *X* vs. Go), but an important one is
the availability of libraries for cloud native projects, since many of them are also written in Go, e.g. Kubernetes,
Prometheus.

The two main libraries we looked at for instrumentation were Prometheus's [`client_golang`](https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang)
and OTel's [Go implementation](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go). The Prometheus lib is much more stable
and widely used -- it's the OG -- but OTel has the "do it once" approach for all observability data, not just metrics
as is the case with Prometheus.

We build on top of Kubernetes using the Operator Pattern and the [controller-runtime library](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime).
Unfortunately, they use a hardcoded global registry from the Prometheus `client_golang` (see [controller-runtime#210](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/issues/210))
... :skull: ...

```go
// https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/blob/c48baad70c539a2efb8dfe8850434ecc721c1ee1/pkg/internal/controller/metrics/metrics.go
import (
	"github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus"
	"sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/metrics"
)

// ...
ReconcileTotal = prometheus.NewCounterVec(prometheus.CounterOpts{
  Name: "controller_runtime_reconcile_total",
  Help: "Total number of reconciliations per controller",
}, []string{"controller", "result"})
// ...

metrics.Registry.MustRegister(
  ReconcileTotal,
  // ...
)
```

_Shiiit_, we're not gonna get to use the new shiny thing!

But wait! OTel supports many formats for exposing metrics, and the Prometheus support is so flexible I was able to
find a way :muscle:

## Instrumenting

To get data out, you create an OTel _exporter_.

```go
package promdemo

import (
	"context"
	"log"

	// Import the global metrics registry from controller-runtime
	ctrlmetrics "sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/metrics"

	// Import the OTel Prometheus Exporter
	otelprom "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/exporters/prometheus"

	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/metric"
)

func main() {
	// Use the WithRegisterer option to specify the Prometheus registry to use.
	// It will default to the global default Prometheus Registry, which is not used by controller-runtime.
	exporter, err := otelprom.New(otelprom.WithRegisterer(ctrlmetrics.Registry))
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }

  // Now configure some metrics using OTel
  // Base on: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go/blob/404f999fd0315a36be322f35c6b9b74746808028/example/prometheus/main.go
  provider := metric.NewMeterProvider(metric.WithReader(exporter))
  meter := provider.Meter("github.com/austince/blog")
  	counter, err := meter.SyncFloat64().Counter("foo", instrument.WithDescription("a simple counter"))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	ctx := context.Background()
	counter.Add(ctx, 5)


}
```

Now, all the metrics registered with the OTel libraries will be exposed alongside the controller-runtime metrics from the
global registry :tada:

You can use the way you're already using for exposing the Prometheus metrics in that registry
(e.g., the controller-runtime's [`Manager`](https://pkg.go.dev/sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime@v0.13.1/pkg/manager#Manager))
or using the standard Prometheus HTTP library:

```go
package promdemo

import (
	"log"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus/promhttp"
	ctrlmetrics "sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime/pkg/metrics"
)

func serveMetrics() {
	log.Printf("serving metrics at localhost:2223/metrics")

	handler := promhttp.HandlerFor(ctrlmetrics.Registry, promhttp.HandlerOpts{})
	http.Handle("/metrics", handler)
	err := http.ListenAndServe(":2223", nil)
	if err != nil {
		log.Printf("error serving http: %v", err)
		return
	}
}
```


## Bonus: What I've learned OpenTelemetry is

There's so much under the OTel umbrella. This is what I think it is:

* A specification for:
  * Data Formats (Traces, Metrics, Logs, Baggage)
  * APIs
  * SDKs
* Libraries that implement the API + SDK specs in a variety of languages and, sometimes, auto-instrument code
* Community-contributed extensions
* Binaries to run in your system for managing observability data:
  * A Collector that receives, processes, and exports data, running either:
    * alongside your process in an "agent" mode for local sources
    * as a standalone service for remote sources
  * A Kubernetes Operator for managing the OTel ecosystem on top of Kubernetes

They've got a great [glossary](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/glossary/) as well.
